## Known Issues

With the current version the following known issues exist:

* Mitochondrial chromosomes have [alternative start/stop codons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_codon#Alternative_stop_codons), also in vertebrates.\
  This is not currently implemented in the pacakge, so PTC calls for locations on the MT chromosome are only with respect to "normal" stop codons.
